# Facial_Expression_Detection

Facial Expression Detection is a computer vision technique that analyzes human facial movements to interpret underlying emotional states. By processing images or videos and identifying Action Units (AUs)—the fundamental muscle movements defined by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS)—the system can detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise.
This approach enables machines to understand non-verbal human communication, making it highly valuable in fields like psychology (e.g., emotion research and behavioral analysis), human-computer interaction (e.g., adaptive user interfaces), and entertainment (e.g., emotion-driven gaming or film analysis). The key focus is on developing systems that are both accurate and efficient, especially in real-time and mobile environments.
